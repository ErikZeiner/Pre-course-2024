# Pre-course (2024)

In October 2024, I lead the organisation of a 5-day orientation event for incoming students at the Institute of Linguistics, University of TÃ¼bingen. Apart from managing a team of 6 fellow students and attending to various organisational matters, I spoke to the students about our programme and university, gave a brief introduction to programming, and addressed the current issues of Generative AI.
